In 2007 METRO Cash & Carry in close cooperation with Fresh Studio Innovations Asia established a platform in Dalat, Vietnam. All vegetables bought by METRO in Dalat are brought to this platform. Here vegetables are inspected, weighed and processed according to METRO’s requirements after which the vegetables are allocated to the different stores of METRO and loaded onto its trucks.

In 2009 Fresh Studio Innovations Asia took over the management of this platform and is now responsible for all its daily activities, including but not limited to the following:
►	Preparing
►	Receiving
►	Stamping of date codes
►	Inspecting quality
►	Weighing
►	Processing (i.e. sorting, grading, washing, trimming, cutting, weighing, labelling, packing)
►	Allocating
►	Cool storing
►	Palletizing
►	Loading
►	Inventory management (i.e. crates in, crates out, crates in stock, products in stock)

Every day a lot of data is collected and stored at several locations.

With (1) the product assortment, specifications, volumes, and activities increasing week by week, and (2) METRO and Fresh Studio starting a similar platform project in North Vietnam, there is an urgent need to store all the data together into one location and link it in such a way that this data can be analysed quickly.
